Compulsory 
     -I create a Maven project
     -I create an object-oriented model of the problem
     -I create the streets and the intersections of the problem 
     -I create a list of streets, using LinkedList implementation and sort it by the length
     -I create a set of intersections, using a HashSet implementation
Homework 
     -I create a class that describes the city
     -Using Java Stream API, I write a query that display all the streets that are longer than a specified value and join at least 3 streets
     -I generate random fake names for intersections and streets
     -I use org.jgrapht.alg.spanning package of JGraphT in order to solve the problem 
Bonus 
     -I implement an algorithm that determines the route of the maintenance car, in order to minimize the total length
     -I create a random problem generator, making sure that the lengths between intersections satisfy the triangle inequality
