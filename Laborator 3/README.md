Compulsory

-object-oriented model of the problem

-I create the interfaces Identifiable and Storage

-I create and print all the nodes in the network

Homework

-I create and print the complete network in the example

-I create a default method in the interface Storage, that is able to return the storage capacity in other units of storage (megabyte, kilobyte, byte)

-I create a method to display the nodes that are identifiable, sorted by their addresses

-I implement Djikstra agorithm to determine all the shortests times required for data packets to travel from an identifiable node to another

Bonus

-In addition to the time cost, I add the probability of failure between two network nodes

-I implement Djikstra agorithm to determine the safest route for a packet to travel between two given nodes

-I generate random network instances
